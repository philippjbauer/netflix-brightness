# Netflix Brightness Chrome Extension

This extension allows to adjust the brightness of a Netflix Video. I had issues with the brightness lately so I figured I'd write an extension to get into extension development.

There are better plugins on the Chrome Store but hey, where's the fun in that?

What I figured could be done better than the other extensions out there, is to integrate the slider into the Netflix UI. So, I did.

## "Warning"

Hacky and not completely stable yet! Only tested on Chrome 67.
